## 🎯 Key Design Principles to Follow

1. **Bold, unapologetic typography** - Oversized headlines, mix of weights
2. **High contrast** - Dark backgrounds with vibrant accents
3. **Playful but professional** - Animated elements that feel fun without being distracting
4. **Clarity over cleverness** - Every visual element serves a purpose
5. **Interactive storytelling** - Let users explore, not just read

## 1. Hero Section Designs

### Linear (linear.app)
**What to Reference:** Hero headline treatment + animated product UI
- **Visual:** "The product development system for teams and agents" - massive headline with animated interface elements showing real product features
- **Key Pattern:** Hero shows the ACTUAL product in motion, not stock imagery. Cards animate in, tasks update live, creates sense of the product "working"
- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** Show the AI/automation actually working in the hero - could be animated "reports generating" or "campaigns optimizing" in real-time

### Vercel (vercel.com)
**What to Reference:** Dark mode hero with gradient accents + stats credibility bar
- **Visual:** Deep black background, vibrant gradient text, clean monospace typography for technical credibility
- **Key Pattern:** Stats ribbon ("99.999% uptime", "$1.4T processed") immediately after hero establishes credibility
- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** Consider stats bar after hero: "500+ campaigns launched", "47% average ROI increase", etc.

### basement.studio (basement.studio)
**What to Reference:** Agency attitude in headline + client logo ticker
- **Visual:** "We make cool shit that performs" - unapologetic, memorable headline. Horizontal scrolling client logos (Vercel, Linear, Cursor, MrBeast)
- **Key Pattern:** Combines attitude with credibility. Bold claim backed by recognizable logos
- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** Could adapt: "AI-powered marketing that actually works." followed by client/result logos

### Raycast (raycast.com)
**What to Reference:** Keyboard-centric animation + feature highlights
- **Visual:** Animated keyboard with feature callouts appearing on different keys. Shows product through metaphor rather than screenshot
- **Key Pattern:** Creative visual metaphor that's interactive and memorable
- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** Could show "marketing dashboard" elements revealing features on hover/scroll

## 2. Interactive Industry/Service Showcases

### Obys Agency (obys.agency)
**What to Reference:** Project showcase with hover reveals + industry marquee
- **Visual:** Projects display with large typography, hover reveals full images. Industries scroll horizontally in infinite marquee: "fashion sport technology architecture beauty real estate"
- **Key Pattern:** Marquee creates energy without being obnoxious. Hover states reveal depth
- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** Industry selector could use marquee pattern: "Roofers Landscapers Plumbers HVAC Solar..." with hover state showing work examples

### One Design Company (onedesigncompany.com)
**What to Reference:** Scrolling project cards with taglines
- **Visual:** Each project has brand name + memorable tagline ("As invested as you are", "Clean energy for everyone. Everywhere.")

- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** For industry pages, each could have memorable positioning: "Roofers → 'Fill your calendar, not your stress'", "Landscapers → 'Grow your business, not just lawns'"

### Lusion (lusion.co)
**What to Reference:** "Featured Work" with immersive hover effects
- **Visual:** Project thumbnails that expand dramatically on hover with 3D-like depth effects

### Webflow (webflow.com)
**What to Reference:** Audience-specific value props + toggle interface
- **Visual:** Different messaging for Marketers vs Designers vs Developers, each with relevant feature highlights
- **Key Pattern:** "Choose your persona" interface that customizes the entire value prop
- **Apply to Strategy Stack:** Client Experience could toggle: "See journey for [Roofing] [HVAC] [Landscaping]" with industry-specific examples

### Resend (resend.com)
**What to Reference:** Code-to-visual preview pattern

## 7. Brutalist Design References (brutalistwebsites.com)

### Key Sites for Aesthetic Reference

| Site | URL | What to Reference |
|------|-----|-------------------|
| Are.na | are.na | Clean grid, stark typography, functional brutalism |
| The Creative Independent | thecreativeindependent.com | Editorial brutalism, readable but bold |
| Ghostly | ghostly.com | Dark mode brutalism, music/culture aesthetic |
| Supreme | supremenewyork.com | Minimalist product brutalism |
| Dropbox Design | dropbox.design | Corporate brutalism with warmth |
| Yale School of Art | art.yale.edu | Academic brutalism, chaotic but intentional |
| Balenciaga | balenciaga.com | Fashion brutalism, stark white space |

### Common Brutalist Patterns to Adapt
1. **System fonts** (or deliberately "ugly" fonts) - Strategy Stack could use Inter or a mono font for certain elements
2. **Raw borders** - 1-2px solid black borders instead of soft shadows
3. **Oversized text** - Headlines that dominate the viewport
4. **Minimal color palette** - Usually 2-3 colors max
5. **Grid visibility** - Let the layout grid show through

---

## 8. Animation Pattern Reference

### Page Load Animations
- **Staggered fade-in:** Elements appear sequentially (50-100ms delay each)
- **Text reveal:** Headlines slide up from below with clip mask
- **Scale + fade:** Elements start at 95% scale and grow to 100%

### Scroll-Triggered Animations
- **Parallax sections:** Background moves slower than foreground
- **Progressive reveal:** Stats count up as section enters viewport
- **Sticky elements:** Hero elements pin during scroll, new content slides over

### Hover Micro-interactions
- **Button transforms:** Scale 1.02-1.05 + slight Y-translation (-2px)
- **Link underlines:** Animated underline draws on hover
- **Card lifts:** translateY(-4px) + shadow increase
- **Color shifts:** Background/accent color transition (200-300ms ease)

### Loading States
- **Skeleton screens:** Gray placeholder boxes that pulse
- **Progressive image loading:** Blur-up effect from low-res placeholder
- **Spinner alternatives:** Progress bars, animated icons
