## Tone of Voice

### My Recipe:

Our brand voice is built on three core tones that work together to create a cohesive communication style.

---

### Tone n°1 — Friendly

**→ Intention**

Make the reader feel **welcome, comfortable, and understood**.

The main emotion: **warmth and approachability**.

The reader should walk away feeling like they've just had a chat with a kind, genuine person who's on their side.

**→ Writing Principles**

- **Vocabulary:** Use everyday, positive, inclusive words (e.g., *let's, we, you, great, easy, happy*). Avoid jargon or overly formal phrasing.
- **Sentence rhythm:** Favor short, conversational sentences. Use contractions (*you're, it's, we'll*) to sound natural.
- **Registers / lexical fields:** Encourage familiarity and connection; avoid corporate or distant language.
- **Stylistic devices:** Light metaphors, simple imagery, or small anecdotes that build closeness ("Think of it like chatting with a friend over coffee").

**→ Examples**

✅ **Correct:**
"Hey there! We're so glad you're here. Let's walk through this together — it's simpler than it looks."

❌ **To be corrected:**
"Welcome. Please follow the outlined steps to complete the process efficiently."
*(Too formal, lacks warmth and human touch.)*

---

### Tone n°2 — Humorous

**→ Intention**

Make the reader **smile, laugh, or feel amused** while still delivering the message.

The main emotion: **amusement and delight**.

The reader should remember the message as **fun, clever, and relatable**.

**→ Writing Principles**

- **Vocabulary:** Use playful words, puns, exaggerations, or unexpected comparisons.
- **Sentence rhythm:** Mix short punchlines with slightly longer build-ups — timing is key for humor.
- **Registers / lexical fields:** Encourage wit, exaggeration, or irony; avoid being mean-spirited or sarcastic toward the reader.
- **Stylistic devices:** Hyperbole, humorous analogies, playful understatement, or breaking the fourth wall.

**→ Examples**

✅ **Correct:**
"Updating your software might not sound thrilling — but hey, neither does flossing, and look how great that turns out!"

❌ **To be corrected:**
"Please update your software regularly to maintain optimal performance."
*(Dry, purely informational — no fun at all.)*

---

### Tone n°3 — Encouraging

**→ Intention**

Make the reader feel **motivated, capable, and supported**.

The main emotion: **confidence and determination**.

The reader should finish reading feeling **energized and ready to act**.

**→ Writing Principles**

- **Vocabulary:** Use empowering, positive, and active language (*you can, let's do this, keep going, strong, achieve, progress*).
- **Sentence rhythm:** Strong, clear sentences with momentum — mix short affirmations with slightly longer motivational phrases.
- **Registers / lexical fields:** Encourage optimism and resilience; avoid negativity, doubt, or overly complex phrasing.
- **Stylistic devices:** Repetition for emphasis ("You've got this. You always have."), vivid imagery of success, and uplifting metaphors ("One small step at a time builds a mountain").

**→ Examples**

✅ **Correct:**
"You've got everything it takes to make this happen. Start where you are, and keep moving — every bit counts!"

## General Writing Guidelines

### What This Tone Should Make Readers Feel

Describe what each tone should make the reader feel:

- What is the main emotion that should be conveyed?
- What overall impression should the reader keep after reading?

### Writing Principles Checklist

List the writing rules that help translate intention into text:

- What kind of vocabulary should be used?
- What sentence rhythm should be favored?
- Which registers or lexical fields should be avoided or encouraged?
- Which stylistic devices (metaphors, imagery, anecdotes, etc.) are relevant?

### Examples Best Practices

Provide illustrative sentences that reflect the desired tone. If possible, include:

- "Correct" examples (aligned with the tone)
- "To be corrected" examples (not aligned), to highlight the difference
